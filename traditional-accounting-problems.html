										<h3>Tradicional Accounting Systems</h3>

										<p>Most accounting systems are focused on mandatory state-demanded reports  showing only large blocks of information totally misaligned with the organizationâ€™s business processes. Therefore, when it comes to calculate the cost of a product or service, traditional methodologies give inaccurate values, mostly because they lack the needed granularity and differentiation of information.</p>

										<p> Often, such information is inaccurate because of wrong distribution of overhead costs. Correct distribution of overhead costs is truly essential since they have grown from being a minor share of the total costs to the major one.</p>

										<h3>Tradicional Accounting Problems</h3>
										<p>Tradicional Accounting methodologies have the following issues:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Imprecise:</strong> </li>
											<li><strong>Untraceability:</strong> </li>
											<li><strong>Outdated:</strong> there are new costing methodologies (ABC and TDABC) that overcome the Tradicional Accounting problems. However, they require a lot of expertise and are normally supported by very expensive and complex software solutions.</li>
