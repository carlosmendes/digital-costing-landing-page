										<h3>Tradicional Accounting Systems</h3>

										<p>Most accounting systems are focused on mandatory state-demanded reports  showing only large blocks of information totally misaligned with the organization’s business processes. Therefore, when it comes to calculate the cost of a product or service, traditional methodologies give inaccurate values, mostly because they lack the needed granularity and differentiation of information.</p>

										<p> Often, such information is inaccurate because of wrong distribution of overhead costs. Correct distribution of overhead costs is truly essential since they have grown from being a minor share of the total costs to the major one.</p>

										<h3>Tradicional Accounting Problems</h3>
										<p>Tradicional Accounting methodologies have the following issues:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Imprecise:</strong> traditional methodologies give inaccurate values, mostly because they lack the needed granularity and differentiation of information and also because they assign costs based on averages;</li>
											<li><strong>Untraceability:</strong> most accounting systems are focused on mandatory state-demanded reports showing only large blocks of information totally misaligned with the organization’s business processes, products and services;</li>
											<li><strong>Outdated:</strong> there are new costing methodologies (ABC and TDABC) that overcome the Tradicional Accounting problems. However, they require a lot of expertise and are normally supported by very expensive and complex software solutions.</li>

											<h3>Cost Management Solution</h3>
											<p>Costing and cost analysis should be offered as a service instead of as an investment in a onetime project. Our solution enables organizations to access accurate costing methodologies because costs are diluted over time and the tools needed to perform this cost analysis are also offered as a service. Our solution gives organizations the ability to do onemand cost analysis so that they can constantly evaluate the flow of costs as well as take measures to improve their cost efficiency.</p>
